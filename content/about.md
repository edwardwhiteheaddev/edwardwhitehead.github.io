At SmartTask, I worked remotely on mobile software development, legacy code migration, UI design, and agile processes. I led two major codebase migrations: first from Xamarin Forms (WPF architecture) to Model-View-View Model (MVVM), enabling support for newer Android and iOS versions, and then to .NET MAUI to ensure ongoing compatibility with future platforms.

I am a Full Stack Developer, Mobile Architect, and Entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience designing and scaling cross-platform applications, SaaS platforms, and AI-driven systems. I lead end-to-end product development and have expertise in Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and cloud infrastructure, including Vercel, Azure, and Firebase Hosting.

I have founded several ventures, including Qirvo (an AI-powered command platform with a plugin marketplace and CLI agent), Violt (an AI-driven smart home automation), and Orby (a modular command center for personal and business use). Each is built on open-source cores, extensible plugin systems, and premium cloud-based services.

I have a proven record of building scalable architectures, multi-agent AI systems, automation workflows, and open-source SDKs. I also manage branding, go-to-market strategies, and investor pitches, and excel at leading distributed teams and integrating AI, robotics, IoT, and automation to support business growth.
