# 🔧 Comeback Dashboard — Demo Admin Dashboard

An opinionated demo admin dashboard built to demonstrate modern Next.js patterns and pragmatic production practices. View the live demo at: <https://the-comeback-dashbaord.vercel.app/>

![Dashboard preview](/assets/images/comeback-dashboard.png)

## 🌟 Overview

Comeback Dashboard is a compact, accessible admin UI that focuses on real-world developer concerns: performance, maintainability, and clear separation of server/client responsibilities. It's intentionally a demo — small enough to explore quickly, but structured like a production app.

## 🚩 Why this demo exists

- Showcase app-router patterns (server components, client components, and server actions).
- Demonstrate accessibility-first UI and semantic markup.
- Provide a small, well-organized codebase for interviews, demos, and talks.

## 🧩 Key features

- Responsive layout and mobile-first design
- Accessible navigation and keyboard support
- Data table with pagination and view options
- Theme presets and user preferences
- Minimal, type-safe server actions for CRUD flows
- Clean component architecture suitable for scaling into a product

## 🏗 Architecture

- Next.js (App Router) — server and client components
- TypeScript — types across frontend and server actions
- Tailwind CSS — utility-first styling and presets
- Edge / Serverless deployment on Vercel
- Lightweight state stores for preferences

## 🧪 Stack

Next.js • TypeScript • Tailwind CSS • React • Vercel

## 🚀 Deployment & Source

Live demo: <https://the-comeback-dashbaord.vercel.app/>

Source: the project lives under the `comeback-dashboard` folder in the edwardwhitehead.dev monorepo (private/local workspace). If you want a public repository or a copy, I can help extract and publish a trimmed demo repo.

## ✅ Accessibility & SEO

The demo follows accessible semantic HTML, keyboard navigation patterns, and sensible ARIA usage where required. Pages are optimized for fast FCP and LCP with server rendering for primary content.

## 🧭 Roadmap / next steps

1. Add end-to-end tests and accessibility regression checks
2. Add sample datasets and demo users for a richer showcase
3. Publish a trimmed public repo with setup instructions

If you'd like, I can also generate a small README to include inside the dashboard folder, create social preview images, or extract a public demo repository.
