## PayBee™ - The Queen Bee of Payment Processing

PayBee was a project that was bourne from a gap in the marketplace I saw when visiting a country called Georgia.

PayBee was a FinTech gratuity/payment solution that was initially a concept that eventually turned into a complete Fintech solution, but was eventually cancelled due to legal requirements to run a Fintech company and the limited funds available to continue.

## Project Vision

To create a FinTech solution that would allow for the processing of gratuity payments in a secure and efficient manner.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vue.js/Flutter
- **Backend**: PHP/Laravel
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Cloud Services**: AWS

## Current Status

PayBee was cancelled due to legal requirements to run a Fintech company and the limited funds available to continue.
