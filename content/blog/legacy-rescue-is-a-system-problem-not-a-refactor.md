# Legacy Rescue Is a Systems Problem, Not a Refactor

Most legacy rescues fail before the first line of code is changed.

Teams rush into migrations, rewrites, and refactors without understanding why delivery is failing. The result is a bigger, more expensive version of the same fragile system.

UNIVRS rescues legacy systems by stabilising the delivery system first.

## Why Refactors Fail

Refactors fail because they treat symptoms.

Build failures, runtime errors, and security gaps are signals of deeper systemic issues. Unclear ownership, broken decision flow, and invisible risk create an environment where any change is dangerous.

### The Real Problem Behind Legacy Code

Legacy code is rarely the root cause. It is the evidence.

```typescript
// What teams try to fix
const problem = 'legacy code';

// What actually breaks delivery
const system = {
  ownership: 'unclear',
  decisions: 'bottlenecked',
  risk: 'invisible',
  ai: 'ungoverned'
};

```

## The UNIVRS Legacy Rescue Model

We stabilise before we modernise.

First we map the system. Then we restore decision clarity. Then we make risk visible. Only then do we change the code that matters.

### What Changes First

Delivery becomes calm.

Ownership is explicit. The roadmap is realistic. AI is governed. Engineers stop firefighting and start building.

```typescript
// After stabilisation
const system = {
  ownership: 'explicit',
  decisions: 'clear',
  risk: 'managed',
  ai: 'useful and safe'
};

```

Best Practices

Legacy Stabilisation

- Diagnose First: Map failure patterns before planning migrations.

- Govern AI: Install guardrails so automation reduces risk instead of amplifying it.

Modernisation

- Incremental Change: Small, safe steps beat heroic rewrites.

- Risk Visibility: Every change is justified by explicit delivery risk reduction.

Conclusion

Legacy rescue succeeds when the system becomes stable.

If your codebase feels dangerous to touch, the problem is not the code. It is the delivery system around it.

Book a stabilisation call and we will diagnose it together.
