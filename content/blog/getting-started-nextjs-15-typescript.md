# Getting Started with Next.js 15 and TypeScript

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications even more enjoyable. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through setting up a new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and explore some of the best practices.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up a new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- Understanding the App Router structure
- Implementing proper TypeScript configurations
- Best practices for component organization
- Setting up development tools and linting

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed on your system. You can check your Node.js version by running:

```bash
node --version
```

## Creating a New Next.js 15 Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
```

This command will set up a new Next.js project with:
- TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality
- App Router (the new recommended routing system)

## Project Structure

After running the installation, you'll see a project structure like this:

```
my-nextjs-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── components/
├── lib/
├── types/
└── package.json
```

## Key Next.js 15 Features

Next.js 15 introduces several improvements:

1. **Improved App Router**: Better performance and developer experience
2. **Server Components**: Enhanced server-side rendering capabilities
3. **Turbopack**: Faster builds and hot reloading (in alpha)
4. **Better TypeScript Integration**: Improved type checking and IntelliSense

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow when working with Next.js 15:

- Use Server Components by default for better performance
- Leverage the App Router for new projects
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for your data
- Use the `lib` directory for utility functions
- Keep components small and focused

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 offers a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. By following these best practices and leveraging TypeScript, you can create maintainable, scalable applications that perform well and provide excellent developer experience.
